### Nature & Nuture

The Bunkie experience is your dose of nature with easy access to all that Kawartha Lakes has to offer and just the right amount of utility comforts to free your mind and relax your body. Gaze at the famous Bobcaygeon constellations at your fire pit. The energy here is amazing. 

### The Space
The cozy log cabin is two floors. The first floor includes kitchenette, dining table and sitting area. The compost toilet is tucked away under the stairs. The second floor features a beautiful queen bedroom. You also have private access to a good size outdoor space with a fire pit for your enjoyment. The cabin is located about a 100m short walk from where you park.

### Guest Access
We have a couple of trails for you to enjoy in addition to the space around your cabin.

### Other notes
There is no running water in the cabin but there is a 15 L spring water dispenser inside and access to hot water at the seasonal outdoor shower.

We have a one dog policy and can discuss exceptions. You must let us know if you are bringing your furry friend when you book. We have two dogs of our own and need to manage expectations.

### Location

The cabin is located close to **Bobcaygeon** and **Buckhorn** which provide many amenities, dining, shopping and recreation. *Find the full area guide on the sidebar*
