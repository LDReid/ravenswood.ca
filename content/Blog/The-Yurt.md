<span class="drop-cap">I</span>n the summer of 2022 we made our final touches on what is the offical Ravenswood YURT. Denise made it one of her missions to own one of these special yurts, and a dream was accomplished in that summer. Our yurt was purchased from the Pickering based, family run company [Yurta.](https://yurta.ca/)

The Yurta comes in a kit which includes all of the materials needed to construct the Yurt in a single afternoon. The biggest construction effort on our side was the base that the yurt sits on and the circular floor that the walls wrap around. The base is built in an octagonal configuration and was completed during the spring of 2022. Thanks to the hard work and carpentry of James Reid, nephew of Denise, we had a solid foundation to build our Yurt.

For such a special project, it only makes sense to have the help of special people bring the project to fruition. We rallied friends and neighbors to participate in the raising of the Yurt on July 21st, 2022, and sure enough, just as the instructions said, it only took us an afternoon to begin and complete the full construction of the Yurt. A big thank you to Glen and Alana Hanna, Sabrina, her husband Steve and their son Wyatt for their contributions.

Since completing the Yurt, it has been home to many meditation retreats, bi-weekly spiritual development circles, and other fun miscellaneous activities such as sounds baths, yoga, drum circles and more! e.g. [The Soul of Solstice event.](/blog/soul-of-solstice) All part of the ongoing [Subtle Shift effort](/blog/the-subtle-shift)

PS. If you happen to stay at Ravenswood during a short term rental vacation, we are happy to show you around the Yurt and let you experience the space on your own during your visit.
