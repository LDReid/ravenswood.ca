<span class="drop-cap">S</span>oul of solstice is an annual event hosted at Ravenswood through the Subtle Shift every June for the past couple years. It is an opportunity to celebrate the summer solstice time by gathering visitors in the yurt, participating in discussions and meditations, and moving through various workshops such as yoga, sound baths, crafts, lunch and more. The effort is a collaboration between Denise, Rachelle of [Yoga Mojo](https://www.facebook.com/ShellsYogaMojo) and Angie of [Cedar Dance Designs](https://www.facebook.com/11angiemacarthur) To find more information on how you can participate in the following solstice events or other Subtle Shift events to come, be sure to follow the Subtle Shift either by [newsletter](https://thesubtleshift.ca/all-posts/) or by [social media.](https://www.facebook.com/thesubtleshift)
