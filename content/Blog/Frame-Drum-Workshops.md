<span class="drop-cap">A</span>nuk Atush came to Ravenswood in the summer of 2020 and a series of synchronistic events lead to him living with us for an entire year. Many stories were shared around an open fire about his younger years in Newfound Land and Labrador and his effort around the property was enormously valued. Through the year of him living with us we decided to help each other with earnings by running drum making workshops on our back porch. To share Ravenswood and to share Anukâ€™s great talents with others was a seamless and natural consolidation for our relationship.

We received several requests through the summer and the fall. All of our lucky guests left Ravenswood inspired and satisfied with their new found achievement of building their very own traditional hide drum. Into the summer of 2021, Anuk set sail to his next adventure. His modesty and kindness are an inspiration for everyone who knows him and we wish him the best of luck in where ever great Grandfather takes him next.
